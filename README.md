If you are familiar with Java and C, JavaScript is very easy to learn. All you need to learn is, how to deal with html document. Mostly. This is a very basic inriduction to get you started. This will remain basic in order to keep it simple for those starting new.

1. Open the source file [jstut.html](https://github.com/raguks/jstut/blob/master/jstut.html) in a browser.
2. Try exercise one by one -- you can see the [results here:](http://raguks.github.io/jstut/jstut.html)
3. In the page source read the inline js and script tags starting from the body tag.
4. Make a html file and start writing your own until you can make something similar work.
5. Do not move to the next exercise until you understand what is happening.
6. Refer to W3 Schools link or search over the Internet if you need help.
